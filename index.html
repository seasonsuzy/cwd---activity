    <h3 class="purple-text">HOW & WHY TO SAVE MONEY</h3>
         <p>Savings serve as the foundation for financial freedom and stability. Even if you believe you don't have enough money to save, it's crucial to start. Saving even 10% of your income each month is better than nothing and can help you develop a savings habit. Any sum you have saved will come in handy in the event of a financial emergency or catastrophe. However, it all begins with developing a savings strategy and prioritizing savings as a budget element.

                    <p>Compounding is how your money increases on its own, and it's the primary reason to begin saving as soon as possible. When it comes to compounding, time is your best friend, and the longer you wait, the more money you will have. That is especially true for long-term savings, such as retirement plans. People who wait until their forties or fifties to begin saving will have to put aside far more than those who begin in their twenties.</p>

                    <p>An emergency fund is essential for everyone, but it's crucial to know your basic monthly expenses. Financial advisors recommend having enough savings to cover living expenses for three to six months, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Your family may need more than six months of emergency savings, depending on the number of breadwinners and other sources of cash. This financial safety net ensures you can meet basic financial obligations in case of illness, job loss, unplanned expenses, or medical costs not covered by insurance. An emergency fund is especially important for those uncertain about their job and the job market. Having a budget allows you to calculate the amount needed to cover basic living expenses in case of a sudden income loss. Write down your emergency fund goal and decide on an amount to contribute each month, using the "pay yourself first" rule. Keep the fund in a separate account to avoid non-emergency dips.</p>

                      <p>Budgeting is a crucial aspect of meeting goals and ensuring financial success. It involves setting spending categories, tracking expenditures, monitoring progress, making adjustments, plugging spending leaks, and staying motivated. Creating a budget can increase your chances of financial success by revealing where your money goes and how seemingly insignificant daily or weekly expenditures can add up over time. By tracking expenses, you can make conscious decisions about spending, saving, or investing your money. This can be the difference between never having enough money and being able to afford important things, such as down payment on a house, buying a new car, paying off debt, planning for retirement, or saving for a trip to Switzerland. Despite the time and effort required to get started, the rewards are substantial.</p>
